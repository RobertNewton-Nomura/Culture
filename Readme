A Culture Adaptor, based on the World Values Survey, with a geographical interface.

Using the data from the World Values Survey and the European Values Survey, create an interactive map of cultural
profiles across the world. 

Create a comparison matrix, where different countries can be selected and then compared to each other, across every
different questions within the surveys. These different questions should be grouped together, with a drop down that 
can be opened or closed. The groupings should have a weighted score for each question within the group, which the
user can customise when the drop down is open and each line is being explored. 

Additionally, add the functionality for retrospective and future data to be added.

Add the functionality for users to create family and team groups, where they can complete the world values survey
and european values survey, and then be compared against each other and to other countries. Match profiles to their closest
country.

Add the functionality for users to add an OpenAI API key which can be used to generate the following:
1. The basis for a specific answer to a question, through the cultural lens. - Why people with x score will think that way
2. The lens that they will look through at a user provided situation, given a score or set of scores
3. The difference between two scores, and why they might clash or work well together.
4. How people can work well together, given the score/s of two or more people.
5. How family dyanmics can be made smoother, given the score/s of two or more people.

Each question should not take in personal information and be saved and then when someone else asks the same question,
the answer can be provided to them as well.
